###Installation and Notes

This is a pretty early release of a third-party add-on for SABnzbd.

To run it, just double-click the Headphones.py file (in Windows - you may need to right click and click 'Open With' -> Python) or launch a terminal, cd into the Headphones directory and run 'python headphones.py'.

For additional startup options, type 'python Headphones.py -h' or 'python Headphones.py --help'

There are still a few things that I'm working on:

* Post-processing doesn't work yet. Just use the categories setting with SABnzbd to customize your final download directory.

* Importing your music library takes a long time. That's because for each artist, it tries to find all of their releases before moving on to the next artist. I might stagger how the info gets added, i.e. first it adds all the artists, then it goes back and adds all of their release information.

* "Snatched" downloads don't change status to "Downloaded". I'm keeping a database of snatched downloads, but since post-processing doesn't work yet, I didn't want to change the status until the app knows for sure that the album has downloaded.
